# Garbage Detector

 Add short description of project here > This AI system helps detect the amount of differenet categories of garbage in an image.

![This is an example of one of the streets that the AI runs through to detect garbage.](http://i2.wp.com/www.chinasmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/nanjing-sanitation-workers-strike-dump-garbage-on-streets-01.jpg?resize=900%2C600)

## The Algorithm

Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here. 
This AI just scans the image you import into the system, then it scans through the image to find different garabage items. I inputed examples of garbage items into different categories so that it can sort out all of the categories when it scans the image you import into it.
## Running this project

1. Add steps for running this project.
2. Make sure to include any required libraries that need to be installed for your project to run.

[In this video, I will demonstrate how this code works and just the porcess of working the code using teachable machines.](video link)
